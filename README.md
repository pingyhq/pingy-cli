> The Simple **Frontend Build** Tool. No Configuration, No Plugins.

## Install

```
npm install @pingy/cli --global
```

## Usage

```
Usage: pingy [command]

Commands:

  init            Initialise a new or existing website
  dev [options]   Serve local development version of website
  export          Export website to a folder for distribution
  -h, --help      output usage information
  -V, --version   output the version number
```

### `init`

```
Usage: pingy init [options]

Initialise a new or existing website using Pingy

Options:

  --yarn          Use Yarn instead of NPM for installing packages
  --global-pingy  Don't install local version of Pingy CLI, use global version instead
  --ask           Ask for all init options (don't prompt to use existing init options)
  -h, --help      output usage information
```

`pingy init` will initialise a new or existing website in the current directory.
An interactive prompt will ask you a few questions and can then install requested
dependencies (e.g. Sass, Less, Babel, CoffeeScript etc..). Optionally, `init` can
also scaffold some boilerplate files for your website.

Pingy is zero-configuration but it does place a `.pingy.json` file in your website folder to help Pingy identify the root of your website. Currently, this only contains the default folder name exporting files to ('dist'), you can change this if you like.

### `dev`

```
Usage: pingy dev [options]

Serve local development version of website

Options:

  -h, --help         output usage information
  -p, --port [port]  Use chosen port (otherwise random port will be used)
  -q, --no-open      Don't automatically launch site in web browser
```

Will create a local development server and open the site in your default web browser. Automatically supports live browser reload, compilation/transpilation (with smart caching) and sourcemaps without any configuration.

*Note: If you created your project with `pingy init`, then Pingy will try to add a `run` script (if it doesn't already exist) to your `package.json`. In this case, you can run `npm start`, instead of `pingy dev`.*


### `export`

`pingy export` will export the website so that it's ready to be uploaded wherever you like. Assets will be minified so that your website is super fast.

#### Configuring Export
You can edit the `.pingy.json` file in your website root to change which folder your site will be exported to. You can also add/remove to the `exclusions` array to exclude files/folder from being exported or compiled.

This is what the default `.pingy.json` file looks like:

```json
{
  "exportDir": "dist",
  "exclusions": [
    {
      "path": "node_modules",
      "action": "exclude",
      "type": "dir"
    }
  ]
}
```

This will export your site to a folder named 'dist' within your website's folder.
It will also exclude the 'node_modules' folder from your exported build.

Let's try changing our `.pingy.json` to something a bit different:

```json
{
  "exportDir": "exported-site",
  "exclusions": [
    {
      "path": "bower_components",
      "action": "dontCompile",
      "type": "dir"
    },
    {
      "path": "*.json",
      "action": "exclude",
      "type": "file"
    }
  ]
}
```

This will export your site to a folder named 'exported-site' within your website's folder.
It will exclude any files that have the 'json' extension and it will copy the
'bower_components' folder and internal file but it won't compile any of those files.
For example, if Pingy CLI sees a SASS or CoffeeScript file then it won't try to compile it,
it also won't try to minify HTML, CSS or JS files within 'bower_components'.

*Better documentation for this functionality is coming soon. For the moment, feel free to create an issue if you want more information.*

## Is there an example repo where I can try out Pingy CLI?

Sure, you can clone [the repo for the website](https://github.com/pingyhq/pingy-cli-website). It uses Sass and Babel.
